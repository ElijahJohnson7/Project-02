# Project-02

For this project, I wanted to design something that would be close to or reminscent of the desktop that I usually use when I am at home. This automatically meant the design would have to be something that is simple and also aesthetically pleasing as well. But it also needed to translate to the other compatible screen sizes as well. I initally began working on the HTML without knowing exactly how I wanted lay everything out completely. I decided to utilize PNG images of applications to match what I would usually have displayed on my computer, and converted them into buttons. I also separated the site into three main parts which would be the top navigation bar, the primary content in the middle, and then the applications at the bottom. The primary content is also displayed exactly how it is on my desktop. It was a little tricky to try and convert it into the mobile format to begin, because I acidentally started coding it for the desktop first, so I needed to backtrack a little bit after I had already begun the CSS. The CSS like always is what was the most difficult for me, especially trying to figure out how to keep the content consistent for different screen sizes. I went back and forth for days and managed to get it to mostly display correctly at specific screen sizes, but it keeps messing up when it is actually resizing, mostly because of the margins in the primary content.
